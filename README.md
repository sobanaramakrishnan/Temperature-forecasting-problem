# Temperature-forecasting-problem
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are particularly well-suited for time series forecasting tasks, such as temperature prediction. This task involves predicting future temperature values based on historical data.
